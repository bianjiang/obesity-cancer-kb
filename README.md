*Abstract*

Obesity is associated with increased risks of various types of cancer, as well as a wide range of other chronic diseases.  On the other hand, access to health information activates patient participation, and improve their health outcomes.  However, existing online information on obesity and its relationship to cancer is heterogeneous ranging from pre-clinical models and case studies to mere hypothesis-based scientific arguments.  A formal knowledge representation (i.e., a semantic knowledge base) would help better organizing and delivering quality health information related to obesity and cancer that consumers need.  Nevertheless, current ontologies describing obesity, cancer and related entities are not designed to guide automatic knowledge base construction from heterogeneous information sources. Thus, in this paper, we present methods for named-entity recognition (NER) to extract biomedical entities from scholarly articles and for detecting if two biomedical entities are related, with the long term goal of building a obesity-cancer knowledge base. We leverage both linguistic and statistical approaches in the NER task, which supersedes the state-of-the-art results. Further, based on statistical features extracted from the sentences, our method for relation detection obtains an accuracy of 99.3% and a f-measure of 99.3%.
